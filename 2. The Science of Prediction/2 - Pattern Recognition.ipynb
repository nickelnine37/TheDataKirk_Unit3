    "# 2 - Prediction from Data\n",

    "Hello! Welcome to another lesson. This week, we are going to begin learning how we can tackle real problems in data science. The focus of this lesson will be on the concept of prediction from data. \n",

    "Making predictions about the future given past data is, in essence, the basic task that we are almost always trying to solve when we do data science. It is a very general description that fits in many different circumstances. \n",

    "Note that the word 'prediction' doesn't *necessarily* mean we want to guess the outcome of something that will occur in the future. It could already be determined, but we just don't know the answer for sure - it it *uncertain*. Consider the example of the first task in the table above, where we want to correctly label a picture as containing a dog or a cat. To a computer (and even to a human if the picture is not very clear) the truth as to which of these options the picture really is, is uncertain. We must make a guess like, we are 70% sure it's a a dog, but there is a 30% chance it's a cat. We are still making a *prediction*. The same goes for all the examples in the table. \n",
